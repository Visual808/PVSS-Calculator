# PVSS Calculator üõ°Ô∏è

*Physical Vulnerability Scoring System Calculator*

A GUI-based tool for assessing and scoring physical security and social engineering vulnerabilities. This calculator helps security professionals quantify risks related to physical access controls, social engineering attacks, and human-factor vulnerabilities.

## üéØ Purpose

Unlike traditional vulnerability scanners that focus on digital threats, PVSS Calculator addresses the physical and human elements of security by providing standardized scoring for:

- **Physical Security Vulnerabilities** - Assess weaknesses in access controls, facility security, and physical barriers
- **Social Engineering Risks** - Evaluate susceptibility to human-based attacks and manipulation tactics
- **Human Factor Assessment** - Score vulnerabilities related to employee behavior and security awareness

## ‚ú® Features

- **User-Friendly GUI** - Intuitive interface for easy vulnerability assessment
- **Standardized Scoring** - Consistent methodology for rating physical and social vulnerabilities
- **Comprehensive Assessment** - Covers multiple aspects of physical and human security
- **Risk Prioritization** - Helps organizations focus on the most critical physical vulnerabilities

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Visual808/PVSS-Calculator.git
cd PVSS-Calculator

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python pvss_calculator.py
```

## üìä Vulnerability Categories

The PVSS Calculator typically assesses vulnerabilities across several domains:

- **Access Control** - Badge systems, locks, entry points
- **Surveillance** - Camera coverage, monitoring gaps
- **Perimeter Security** - Fencing, barriers, detection systems
- **Social Engineering** - Phishing susceptibility, pretexting risks
- **Employee Awareness** - Security training effectiveness, policy compliance
- **Incident Response** - Physical security incident handling

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Security Audits** - Standardized assessment of physical security posture
- **Risk Management** - Quantify and prioritize physical security investments
- **Compliance** - Support regulatory requirements for physical security
- **Penetration Testing** - Document physical and social engineering findings
- **Security Awareness** - Identify training needs and awareness gaps

## üìà Scoring Methodology

The PVSS scoring system provides numerical ratings that help organizations:
- Compare vulnerabilities across different physical security domains
- Track improvement in physical security posture over time
- Communicate risk levels to management and stakeholders
- Prioritize remediation efforts based on calculated risk scores
